# Calcite's source

Calcite is written in [Calx](https://github.com/ellipog/calx). Module `a.b` is the file `src/a/b.calx` ([modules](https://github.com/ellipog/calx/blob/main/docs/reference/modules.md)). Every module that reproduces vanilla behavior is checked bit for bit by the [oracle rig](../rig/README.md).

| Module | What it is | Vanilla's |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `random.source` | `RandomSource`, the interface every random source implements; `Bits`, a source built on `next(bits)`, with the formulas built on it; the polar Gaussian; `position_seed` | `RandomSource`, `BitRandomSource`, `MarsagliaPolarGaussian`, `Mth.getSeed` |
| `random.legacy` | `LegacyRandom`, Java's 48-bit LCG, and `LegacyPositional` | `LegacyRandomSource`, `SingleThreadedRandomSource` and their positional factory |
| `random.xoroshiro` | `XoroshiroRandom` on xoroshiro128++, and `XoroshiroPositional` | `XoroshiroRandomSource`, `Xoroshiro128PlusPlus`, `RandomSupport`'s seeding |
| `random.worldgen` | `WorldgenRandom<T>` over a legacy or xoroshiro source, with its chunk and feature seeding | `WorldgenRandom` |
| `hash.md5` | MD5, for seeding from names and for offline players' UUIDs | Guava's `Hashing.md5()` |
| `java.text` | `string_hash`, Java's `String.hashCode` over UTF-16 code units | `String.hashCode` |
| `java.uuid` | `Uuid`, two `i64`s, written as Java writes them | `java.util.UUID` |
| `resources.identifier` | `Identifier`, a namespace and a path, parsed with vanilla's rules and messages | `Identifier` |
| `auth.profile` | `GameProfile` and `ProfileProperty`, as the login sends them | authlib's `GameProfile` and `Property`, `ByteBufCodecs.GAME_PROFILE` |
| `protocol.state` | `State`, the five protocol states, and `Bound`, a packet's direction | `ConnectionProtocol`, `PacketFlow` |
| `protocol.ids` | The protocol version and each state's packet names in ID order, written by [`calx_tables.py`](../oracle/datagen/README.md#calx-modules) | The order packets register in each state's protocol |
| `protocol.wire` | `Reader` and `Writer`, the `Wire` and `Packet` interfaces, `write_packet` | `FriendlyByteBuf`, `VarInt`, `VarLong`, `Utf8String`, `ByteBufCodecs` |
| `protocol.codegen` | The attributes that write packets' code: `@packet`, `@packets`, `@wire`, `@wire_enum` | Each packet's `STREAM_CODEC`, `IdDispatchCodec`, `PacketDecoder` |
| `protocol.handshake`, `protocol.status`, `protocol.login` | Their states' packets | The packets in `network.protocol.handshake`, `.status`, `.login` and `.cookie` |
| `rig.adapter` | The rig adapter's main: answers `hello`, `run` and `bye` | |
| `rig.frame`, `rig.json` | The rig's frames, and the JSON in their headers | |
| `rig.rng` | The `rng` probe | |
| `rig.collections` | The `collections` probe: Calx's Java-ordered tables against Java's and fastutil's | |

## Random sources

```calx
import random.legacy.{LegacyRandom}
import random.worldgen.{WorldgenRandom}

fn main() {
    var r = LegacyRandom.new(42)
    println("{r.next_int()} {r.next_int_below(10)}")    // out: -1170105035 3
    var w = WorldgenRandom.new(LegacyRandom.new(0))
    w.set_large_feature_seed(12345, 3, -7)
    println("{w.next_long()}")                        // out: 8624464025789168634
}
```

The same numbers as `new java.util.Random(42)`, and as seeding one with `setLargeFeatureSeed`'s formula. A type's interface methods need no import: `next_int` works on a `LegacyRandom` because the type implements `RandomSource`.

How they're built (D86):

- Each source is a small `Copy` struct, 24 to 32 bytes, so it lives on the stack or inside whatever owns it, with no allocation and no atomics. Vanilla's `LegacyRandomSource` uses an `AtomicLong` only to detect misuse from two threads, which region actors rule out.
- Calls go through generics, not virtual calls. `RandomSource` methods on a `LegacyRandom` compile to straight-line C. `WorldgenRandom<T>` is one generic struct for both inner sources, so each copy is specialized.
- `SingleThreadedRandomSource` is `LegacyRandom`: it gives the same numbers.
- A bound vanilla rejects, such as `next_int_below(0)`, panics, since vanilla throws `IllegalArgumentException` there and nothing catches it.
- Every constant was read from the bytecode with `javap`: the decompiler prints one of `XoroshiroRandomSource`'s doubles as a float ([found by the rig](../rig/README.md#found-so-far)).

The rig's `rng` probe runs 182 cases through every source and operation, including the rejections, and Calcite passes all of them on Windows and Linux.

## Packets

A packet is a struct named as vanilla's class without `Packet`, marked with `@packet` and the name vanilla gives it (D126). The attribute writes the code that reads and writes it, from its fields in order, and its ID in each state, from `protocol.ids`:

```calx
import java.uuid.{Uuid}
import protocol.codegen.{packet}
import protocol.state.{State, Bound}
import protocol.wire.{Reader}

/// Vanilla's `ServerboundHelloPacket`.
@packet(Bound.Serverbound, "hello")
pub struct ServerboundHello {
    @max(16)
    pub name: String
    pub profile_id: Uuid
}

fn main() {
    var r = Reader.new([4, 65, 108, 101, 120, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2])
    match ServerboundHello.read(mut r) {
        ok(p) => println("{p.name} {p.profile_id.to_string()}"),    // out: Alex 00000000-0000-0001-0000-000000000002
        err(e) => println(e.message),
    }
    println("{ServerboundHello.id(State.Login)} {ServerboundHello.id(State.Play)}")    // out: 0 -1
}
```

- A field is written as its type says: `bool`, the integers and floats big-endian, `String` with its UTF-8 length first, `Uuid` as two `i64`s, `List<u8>` as a byte array, any other list with its count first, an optional with a `bool` first, and any other type with its own `Wire`. `@varint` writes an `i32` or `i64` as a VarInt or VarLong, `@max(n)` limits a string's UTF-16 units or a list's length, and `@rest` makes a `List<u8>` every byte left.
- Reading checks what vanilla checks, in its order, and fails with its message, such as `The received string length is longer than maximum allowed (17 > 16)`.
- A packet in several states, such as `cookie_response` in login and configuration, has an ID in each, and `-1` where it isn't one.
- A name vanilla doesn't have is a compile error that suggests the closest: ``vanilla 26.3 has no serverbound packet `intentoin`; did you mean `intention`?``

An enum marked `@packets` reads every packet a client can send in one state. Each variant is named after its packet, which gives the ID it's read for:

```calx
import protocol.handshake.{ClientIntent, ClientIntention, HandshakeIn}
import protocol.state.{State}
import protocol.wire.{Reader, Writer, write_packet}

fn main() {
    let intention = ClientIntention { protocol_version: 777, host_name: "localhost", port: 25565, intention: ClientIntent.Login }
    var w = Writer.new()
    write_packet(intention, State.Handshake, mut w)
    let bytes = w.into_bytes()
    println("{bytes.len()} bytes, ID {bytes[0]}")    // out: 16 bytes, ID 0
    var r = Reader.new(bytes)
    match HandshakeIn.read(mut r) {
        ok(HandshakeIn.Intention(p)) => println("{p.host_name}:{p.port}"),    // out: localhost:25565
        err(e) => println(e.message),
    }
}
```

`read` takes a frame's bytes after its length and any compression, as vanilla's `PacketDecoder` does: the ID, then the packet, which must end where the frame does. It fails with vanilla's messages, such as `Received unknown packet id 5`, and says which packet failed to decode: `Failed to decode packet 'serverbound/minecraft:intention': Unknown connection intent: 4`.

## Tests

`src/test/` holds Calx tests that need no vanilla data, such as MD5's published test vectors. Each panics on a wrong result and prints `ok`:

```sh
py -I src/test/run.py                   # every test and every example on this page, debug and release
py -I rig/runner/rig.py score           # everything the rig can check
```

An example's `// out:` comments give the lines it must print, as in Calx's own docs. Both commands run in CI on Windows and Linux. A test's source root is `src/`, since it starts with a `module test.<name>` line, so it imports Calcite's modules as Calcite does.
